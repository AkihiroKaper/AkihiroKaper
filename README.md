## Welcome to my page!! 🧡

My name is *Patrick Akihiro* and I'm knew at this stuff so I'm not sure if I'll be uploading that many of projects, but I'll try best to! 😉😄

- I'm currently learning `JavaScript` on **[Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/)**
- Japanese in the **[Escola de Língua Japonesa - Bunkyo Suzano](https://cblj.org.br/pt/escola/2160/escola-de-lingua-japonesa-bunkyo-suzano)**
- And I'm using this space to organize and share my projects so I can improve my skills (if I have any 😆) with your comments and hints 👍😃
